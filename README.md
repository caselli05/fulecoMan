![Fuleco Pacman Remake](path/to/image.png)

## Description
This is a remake of the classic **Pacman** game, developed in Assembly for the **RISC-V** architecture. Instead of Pacman, you play as Fuleco, the mascot of the 2014 World Cup, and the ghosts are players from the German national team that defeated Brazil in the infamous semi-final. The goal is to help Fuleco escape the players and restore his honor!

- **Enemies:** Players from the German national football team.
- **Classic Pacman movement** with keyboard controls.
- **Score system** inspired by the original game.
- **Developed in Assembly for RISC-V architecture**.

## Requirements
To run the game, you will need:
- A **RISC-V simulator or emulator** (such as Spike or QEMU)
- **RISC-V GCC compiler** or another compatible assembler
